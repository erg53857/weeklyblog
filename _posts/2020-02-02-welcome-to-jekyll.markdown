This week our senior design team was working on becomming more familiar with AWS lamda functions as well as throwing and calculating load onto a ubuntu server. For calculating load we learned that there are several ways to do it. We came across a load generator called 'hey' which was a simple program that allowed us to  throw a small amount of load to the our free tier server. We needed this to see if our our lamda function would reconize the load and scale the server up. When setting up the Lamda funtion we simply followed a step by step guide from the AWS website. Were going to be continuing to learn more about Lamda in the next comming weeks as we just now have a much cleaner understanding on how to genreate and calculate load onto the server.
